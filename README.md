# Mad Libs
Valerie's [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) is a word game that is great for passing time between [Pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. Mad Libs was one of my favorite games as a child, so I decided to create my own version to demonstrate my comfort with various functions and elements.
